            <p>I love to paint and draw, whether it's digital or traditional. Take a look at my gallery and let me know if you are interested in having me work for you! I am open to commissions and contract work and I would love to hear about your project or idea.</p>
            <P>Through 2018 I would like to start helping folks with projects, ideas and general art needs! If you are interested, or know anyone who's interested in getting background or character art, please send them my way! I would love to find new folks to work with and so long as you or they are professional and/or courteous, I'm very happy to create whatever is needed.</P>
